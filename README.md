# Mini-STG-Wasm: a mini compiler

This is an attempt to compile Spineless Tagless G-Machine ( STG ) language to Web-Assembly bytecode.

## About the mini-STG language
The language is similar to the language defined in the classical STG paper by Simon Peyton Jones in 1992: *[The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fsimonpj%2Fpapers%2Fslpj-book-1987%2Findex.htm)*.

The syntax file is modified from the syntax file used in [quchen/STGi](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stgi), since the simplified syntax is just enough to prove my method.
